# DIVAnd in R

## Introduction

DIVAnd is a software tool, written in Julia, designed to interpolate in situ measurements onto a regular grid.
The tool has been applied in several European projects to create climatologies for variable such as temperature, salinity or eutrophication variables.

`R` is a languague widely used in the scientific community, hence the interface to call DIVAnd within R is the objective of the present project.
